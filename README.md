# SMILES
Concealed time series adversarial attacks

## Notebook
This notebook implements:
— An LSTM classifier for time series data.
— Model-based adversarial attacks using LSTM and ResCNN surrogate models.
— Gradient-based adversarial attacks:

1. Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)
2. Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (iFGSM)

— Comparative analysis of gradient-based vs. model-based attacks using the fooling rate metric.
